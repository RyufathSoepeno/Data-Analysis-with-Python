    "1. **Does the greedy algorithm return the optimal solution?**\n",
    "With thorough analysis, I would say that the greedy algorithm doesn’t ensure the optimal solution here. While it selects cows based on the highest IQ density, it does not account for the overall combination of cows across trips, which may lead to a suboptimal total IQ. Essentially, the strategy might miss the big picture of what’s best for the entire journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do you evaluate greedy algorithms in general? How about this case?**\n",
    "Greedy algorithms are generally valued for being fast and delivering workable solutions. Here, the greedy approach is quick and simple, making it practical for time-sensitive tasks. However, since it prioritizes one metric (IQ density), it doesn’t always lead to the highest possible IQ total, as it might ignore combinations that would fit better across multiple trips the Aucks would make and that the approximation quality may vary since it might not yield the maximum possible IQ sum due to the limitations of density-based selection\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If not, what could be a solution that can find the optimal solution?**\n",
    "For the absolute best solution, a dynamic programming algorithm would be more reliable. Dynamic programming (DP) is suitable for the cow transport problem because it allows us to explore and record optimal solutions for subproblems—such as finding the best combination of cows for each trip under the weight constraint. DP efficiently finds the solution by breaking the problem down into overlapping subproblems and storing solutions for these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n",
